# Accessibility Procurement Pilot

<p align="center">LETTER OF INTEREST</p>
<p align="center">ACCESSIBILITY PROCUREMENT PILOT ON BEHALF OF</p>
<p align="center">TREASURY BOARD OF CANADA SECRETARIAT</p>


## 1. PURPOSE 

The purpose of this Letter of Interest (LOI) is to notify industry of GC’s intention to:
- issue a Call for Proposals (CFP) in relation to the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat’s Open by Default Pilot Portal; 
- to provide advance notice of the challenges for which Canada intends to seek proposals; and 
- to provide industry the opportunity to give written feedback on the requirement and procurement strategy. 

Canada is looking to partner more closely with leading innovators in Canada and abroad to help address accessibility issues specifically relating to documents on the Open by Default Pilot Portal, which is housed on the open government website, Open.canada.ca (“Open Government website”).

## 2. BACKGROUND 

The Government of Canada (“GC”) is committed to advancing openness and transparency. Governments today face barriers to being completely open to all Canadians. About 14% of Canadians report having a disability that limits day-to-day activities. With an aging population, this percentage will likely increase. Many Canadians also live with invisible disabilities. Others may not wish to report having one. Canada faces a clear imperative to be inclusive. For a multitude of reasons we must work to remove barriers to persons with disabilities in this country.

The accelerating pace of digital change means that new tools are being introduced. Most do so without consideration for accessibility, others are focus on enhancing it. Accessibility issues can be both varied and complex. Emerging approaches show promise in helping to reduce barriers. Canada is committed to raising the bar on accessibility to be an international leader for equality and human rights.


### 2.1 EXISTING WEB STANDARDS, GUIDANCE, AND RESOURCES

The GC Open Government committments rely on open standards, of which the following shoul be considered for this project.

These are the guidelines currently required for GC websites: 
- GC Standard on Web Accessibility – A Government of Canada standard for websites and web applications - https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=23601
- GC Guidance on Implementing the Standard on Web Accessibility – Assists departments by providing tools, solutions and guidance - https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/government-communications/guidance-implementing-standard-web-accessibility.html
- World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 - the international 2008 standard for web accessibility.  Governments around the world have adopted WCAG 2.0 AA as the goal for most web sites. https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag
- GC’s Web Experience Toolkit - http://wet-boew.github.io/wet-boew/
- Other relevant policies to Canada’s Web presence - https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/index-eng.aspx
    1. Directive on the Management of Communications
    2. Directive on Official Languages for Communications and Services
    3. Standard on Web Interoperability
    4. Standard on Web Usability
    5. Standard on Optimizing Websites and Applications for Mobile Devices

Like all digital medium itself, change is inevitable. GC takes inspiration from internationally recognized standards that support an improved user experience for all users. 

Where possible, the project should take into consideration the best practices outlined in these open standards:
- W3C WCAG 2.0 AAA - these guidelines were designed to be aspirational. Where possible see if it is possible to leverage these standards.
- W3C Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0 - This 2015 guideline is in two parts. Part A asks that the authoring experience meets WCAG 2.0 guidelines. Part B supports the production of more accessible web content through better software. 
- W3C WCAG 2.1 W3C Working Draft - Although still a Working Draft, this revision of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0, is working to provide better access for a broader range of people. Content that conforms to WCAG 2.1 also conforms to WCAG 2.0, and therefore to policies that reference WCAG 2.0 - https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/
- European Union EN 301 549 – A European Union initiative for public procurement for improving accessibility of information and communications technology (ICT) products and services. Specifies the functional accessibility requirements applicable to ICT products and services. Each accessibility requirement includes a description of the test procedures and evaluation methodology - http://mandate376.standards.eu/standard

# Attachment 3 

Statement of Work for Open by Default Pilot Portal Challenge

## 1. Introduction

The Government of Canada has outlined commitments to advance openness and transparency through Action Plans on Open Government submitted to the Open Government Partnership since 2012. One of the core mandates expressed in these action plans is to advance openness through the open government website - https://open.canada.ca

The Open Government website was initially launched as a pilot, data.gc.ca, in 2011. The pilot open data portal then expanded to include various information resources and to facilitate engagement on the open government initiative and associated activities. In keeping with Canada’s initial strategy on open government, the Open Government website’s architecture is built around the pillars of open data, open information and open dialogue, and its infrastructure is built on open source solutions: CKAN, Drupal 7 and Solr. As Canada continues to advance the open government initiative and to release a growing number of resources, it has become apparent that the accessibility of content needs to be improved. There is also a desire to do more in terms of engaging with users and visitors through the Open Government website.

GC is committed to removing barriers to access for Government information and services. With that in mind, GC is mandated to ensure that all websites and web applications adhere to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 AA. 

New resources of information are constantly being added to the Open Government website and the future vision is for it to become a hub of data, information and opportunities to participate and learn. Early research indicates that a majority of users are seeking data of one type or another, with a smaller but significant group looking for opportunities to participate or engage with government.

As Canada’s work on open government advances, there are opportunities to improve the user experience of its online tools, including improving access to digital publications and draft documents made available by the Government of Canada.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 The Open by Default Pilot Portal (http://pilot.open.canada.ca/open-by-default-pilot) 

The new Open by Default Pilot Portal (Pilot Portal) is the latest component of the Open Government website. This is an online beta site where non-sensitive federal working documents available to the public. This provides users with insight into what Government of Canada employees are working on. The Open by Default Pilot Portal leverages existing operational systems that power open.canada.ca. These include CKAN, Drupal 8 and Apache Solr. It also leverages GCDocs, an internal records management tool. The technical architecture of the Open by Default Pilot Portal, mirrors that of the Open Government Portal. Instructions to build the environment will be provided as well as all source code for the architecture. Currently all code for this project is available on GitHub - https://github.com/open-data

The Pilot Portal consolidates draft documents (“Digital Assets”) provided by pilot departments. The current departments are Natural Resources Canada, Canadian Heritage, Environment and Climate Change Canada, and the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat. The  Digital Assets in the pilot may not comply with web accessibility standards. 

Currently, the Pilot Portal contains approximately 550 Digital Assets. These are in common open formats such as .odf, .csv, .svg, .shp, but also standard Microsoft & Adobe file formats. The collection contains draft policies, internal draft documentation on systems, and presentations. It is expected that future Digital Assets holdings on the portal could be expanded to include audio and video formats. It is also expected that collection could include 100,000s of Digital Assets.

## 3. Challenge 

TBS has a requirement for an open source software solution (“Solution”) (existing or developmental but not proprietary) to enhance and improve the accessibility of both current and future Digital Assets housed on the Open by Default Pilot Portal. Proposed Solutions must also be compatible with the Open Government website’s existing digital infrastructure.

The following illustrative list provides examples of accessibility issues Solutions may address in responding to the challenge. This list is non-exhaustive. All Solutions should assume bilingual content. These are examples of Solutions that may be addresed in the CFP. Ability of the system to:
- automatically flag Digital Assets when they fail to meet WCAG 2.0 AA. This system should allow for marking WCAG 2.1 and/or EN 301 549 requirements when they become available. It is understood that the best automated tests presently catch about 25% of WCAG 2.0 AA errors. 
- ensure Digital Assets available through the Open by Default Pilot Portal should be able to be converted into a in a variety of formats such as EPUB3, and ODF; 
- provide for all Digital Assets an embed an accessibility compliance report against WGAC 2.0 AA standards as well as other web accessibility standards; 
- programmatically suggest alternative text for images (.gif, .png, .svg, and .jpg).
- programmatically generate transcripts of voice audio recordings; 
- programmatically generate described video, transcripts, closed captioning for video content created in both official languages;
- programmatically generate animated American Sign Language or Quebec Sign Language from spoken word audio or video; 
- programmatically assign and display Flesch-Kincaid (or similar) readability tests to determine approximate grade level for English content or Scolarius score for French content;
- conform to ATAG 2.0 Part B where editors are encouraged to adopt best practices while generating content, such that it is easier to comply with WCAG 2.0 AA. Where possible also conform to WCAG 2.1 and/or EN 301 549.

Reports and documentation deliverables will be accepted when all discrepancies, errors or other deficiencies identified in writing by the Technical Authority have been corrected.

The Contractor must provide drafts all Reports and Documentation deliverables to the Technical Authority for review 10 business days prior to the specified due date. The Technical Authority will provide comments to the Contractor 5 business days prior to the due date. 

All of the Technical Authority's comments to deliverables must either be incorporated in the succeeding version of the deliverable or the Contractor must demonstrate to the Technical Authority’s satisfaction why such comments should not be incorporated.

If the Contractor requires additional guidance to produce an acceptable deliverable, the Contractor must arrange a meeting with the Technical Authority.

# Not Useful For Procurement

It is anticipated that a CFP in French and English versions will be posted electronically on the Government Electronic Tendering Service (GETS), namely the Buy and Sell website (https://buyandsell.gc.ca/). 

This requirement is subject to Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA), Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the World Trade Organization’s Agreement on Government Procurement (WTO-AGP).


The Canadian Content Policy does not apply to this requirement. 





# Appendix X

## With respect to Phase 1 of the Procurement Process

The Contractor will be reimbursed its authorized travel and living expenses reasonably and properly incurred in the performance of the Work, at cost, without any allowance for profit and/or administrative overhead, in accordance with the meal, private vehicle and incidental expenses provided in Appendices B, C and D of the National Joint Council Travel Directive and with the other provisions of the directive referring to "travellers", rather than those referring to "employees".

All travel must have the prior authorization of the Technical Authority.


# Questionable or inconsistent

## How does this compare with the open source committment of Open Government?
The Contractor will own Intellectual Property Rights in Foreground Information - https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/4/4007/3#ownership-of-intellectual-property-rights

Clearly something like openbydefault.PWGSC@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca & TPSGC.paouvertpardefaut@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca would be preferable to this silly email TPSGC.paouvertpardefaut-apopenbydefault.PWGSC@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca 

## I am assuming 3 pages, but you might mean 6:
The  number  of  pages  of  your  response  is  not  limited.  However,  the  expected  length  should  not  exceed  3  
pages double sided standard letter business format.

## This clearly isn't enough information as there are multiple projects under this organization site. What would be useful here is an exact link to the project that contains both the code and the installation instructions. It would be possible to offer a download for a VirtualBox instance that would include a running example of the entire environment. At the very least though this needs to be corrected: 
All source code for the architecture is available on GitHub for reuse here : https://github.com/open-data 

## This just isn't possible!
The absence of the ability for the system to programmatically reduce the reading grade level of the content to a target of grade 8, in accordance with WCAG 2.0 AAA; and,

## I don't think this is what people are calling for in the blind community
Lack  of  ability  within  the  system  to  programmatically  generate  alternate  versions  of  Digital  Assets  
available  through  the  Open  by  Default  Pilot  Portal  in  a  variety  of  braille  formats  such  as  .BRF  and  
.BRL in both official languages;

## It makes no sense for the due date to be within 15 days, considering that this is the time available for clarification with the Technical Authority
Due date: Within 15 working days of Contract award 

## It seems very strange for a government contract to ask for:
  e) Profit: Identify proposed profit, if any, and the basis on which it is computed and applied. 
  
  f) Overhead: State the applicable overhead.

# Accessibility Contracting Best Practices
Building Accessibility Best Practices into Contracting

## Questions for the Procurer (Client):
 - Is there an accessibility specific procurement policy or a procurement policy where accessibility is mentioned?
 - The procurement contract should include language that specifically documents how satisfactory progress on accessibility will be measured. 
 - If the product is currently accessible, the contract should include language that assures continued accessibility as the product is updated. 
 - Who on the organization's side is responsible for evaluating accessibility of the product delivered?
 - Is there a 3rd party audit built into procurment?
 - Do your boiler-plate contracts state that your organization owns the IP generated? If you are using open-source software, do you explicitly support fixing problems (or even reporting) problems in the source libraries?

## RFO requirements section:

We require that all purchases be accessible according to the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 AA. 


or


All content, interfaces, and navigation elements to be used for this project must be compliant with Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 AA. Compliance means that a person with a disability can percieve, operate and understand the interface the same as a person without a disability.


## In section listing the various questions that Vendors need to respond to, include:

### Product
 - Are all interfaces (both for administrators and end-users) that are part of your product compliant with WCAG 2.0 AA?
 - Who will pay to remediate any necessary fixes after purchase?
 - If your product is not WCAG 2.0 AA compliant, do you have a roadmap to make your product fully compliant? If so, include your roadmap. 
 - If we find that there are changes that need to be made to web/mobile interfaces/apps, what guarantee can we have that these will be implemented to our satisfaction prior to go-live/going forward?
 
### Process
 - Describe your accessibility conformance testing process.
 - Describe measures you've taken to ensoure your IT products or services are accessible.
 - Is there an open issue queue of known accessibility issues for the IT product?
 - If there are known barriers for users, vendors should be asked to make a commitment to improving accessibility over a specified timeline.
 - Has your team ever worked with Accessibility as a functional requirement?
 - What are your company's internal standards for developing with accessibility in mind? 
 - Does your company have a road map for accessibility going forward? If so, can you give us a general outline (goals / milestones)?
 - Have you tested and/or developed your mobile apps (especially iOS) with accessibility in mind?
 - What automated tools do developers & designers use to evaluate their work?
 - Describe the steps you take for manual testing of your interface.

### Experience 
 - Do you have clients who require web accessibility? If so, in outline, how are they ensuring your product meets their requirement?
 - Do you do testing with users with disabilities? If so, can you explain the process and identify, roughly, the range of disabilities and access technologies used?
 - What experience do developers on your team have coding for accessibility?
 - Have your developers contributed to any open-source accessibility work you could link to?
 - How do your developers and designers stay up-to-date with best practices with web accessibility?

# Accessibility Contracting Best Practices
Building Accessibility Best Practices into Contracting

## RFP requirements section:

    We require that all purchases be accessible according to the Web Accessibility Initiative 
    (WAI) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 AA. 

or

    All content, interfaces, and navigation elements to be used for this project must be 
    compliant with Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 AA. 
    Compliance means that a person with a disability can percieve, operate and understand the 
    interface the same as a person without a disability.

## Questions for the Procurer (Client):
 - Is there an established accessibility procurement policy or a procurement policy where accessibility is explicitly mentioned?
 - The procurement contract should include language that specifically documents how satisfactory progress on accessibility will be measured. 
 - If the product is currently accessible, the contract should include language that assures continued accessibility as the product is updated. 
 - Is there a 3rd party audit built into procurment?
 - Do your boiler-plate contracts state that your organization owns the IP generated? If you are using open-source software, do you explicitly support fixing problems (or even reporting) problems in the source libraries?
 - How are you planning to use the product?
 - How are Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT)s seen & evaluated within your institution?

### Internal expertise
 - Is there a Accessible Technology Initiative (ATI) person in your organization who can help ensure consistent implementation of Accessible ICT procurement procedures?
 - Who on the organization's side is responsible for evaluating accessibility of the product delivered?
 - Who oversees the review of ICT accessibility compliance documentation?
 - Who coordinates with ICT vendors to resolve issues with accessibility support or documentation?
 - Who is the primary contact for questions regarding Accessible ICT procurement?
 - Does someone coordinate the delivery of Accessible ICT procurement training programs in your institution?
 - Has Vendor inability to provide accessible products has affected purchasing decisions? Who maintains a success/failure record in your institution?
 - Will someone be able and willing to submit problems to the product's issue tracking system?
 - When a product has a fix for a problem that you have identified, who will be able to verify the fix?
 - Who is maintaining the list of what assistive technology is supported?
 - Who is the primary accessibility lead within our organization?

## In section listing the various questions that Vendors need to respond to, include:

### Product
 - Are all interfaces (both for administrators and end-users) that are part of your product compliant with WCAG 2.0 AA?
 - Who will pay to remediate any necessary fixes after purchase?
 - If your product is not WCAG 2.0 AA compliant, do you have a roadmap to make your product fully compliant? If so, include your roadmap. 
 - If we find that there are changes that need to be made to web/mobile interfaces/apps, what guarantee can we have that these will be implemented to our satisfaction prior to go-live/going forward?
 - If you have created a VPAT, is it prepared by a [3rd party](http://www.karlgroves.com/2011/07/07/why-a-third-party-should-prepare-your-vpatgpat/)?
 - What standards are you using to evaluate accessibility?
 - How are accessibility features documented? Are they discoverable by the user?
 - Is this product being used by accessibility focused organizations and are there any reviews by them.
 - WCAG related accessibility barriers are categorized as bugs; not feature requests
 
### Process
 - Describe your accessibility conformance testing process.
 - Describe measures you've taken to ensoure your IT products or services are accessible.

 - What automated tools do developers & designers use to evaluate their work?
 - Describe the steps you take for manual testing of your interface.
 - How are you keeping pace with the changes in Assistive Technology?

### Experience

## This aim of this guide

This aim of this guide is to help you through the process
of hiring an outside contractor to develop an accessible
website and accessible web content for your organization.
The guide offers suggestions on how to identify website
developers who have experience in designing accessible
websites and to bring the project to a successful
conclusion. It also provides a sample of a Request for
Proposal (RFP) to help you assess and choose the right
website developer.

## Background

The Government of Ontario passed the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities
Act in 2005, with the goal of making Ontario accessible for people with
disabilities through the development of accessibility standards. The standards
are rules that organizations in Ontario have to follow to identify, remove and
prevent barriers so that people with disabilities will have more opportunities to
participate in everyday life.
Under the Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation (IASR), the Accessibility
Standard for Information and Communications requires large organizations in
Ontario to take steps to make their websites accessible within a given timeline.
Obligated organizations include any Ontario organization with 50 employees
or more that provides goods, services or facilities to the public or other third
parties.
Starting January 1, 2014 organizations will need to
make sure their new websites and content on those site
conform to WCAG 2.0, Level A, with the exception of
live captioning and audio description. Starting January
1, 2021 organizations will need to make all websites and
web content conform with WCAG 2.0. Level AA, with
the exception of live captioning and audio description.
Organizations do not need to make web content
published before January 1, 2012 accessible.

## Benefits of Web Accessibility

Many organizations have adopted the web as either
a primary or important secondary means of doing
business. As more and more people use the web for
research, purchasing, entertainment and social and
business communications it makes good business
sense for any web-enabled organization to include
as many potential customers as possible. Ensuring
that your website meets the Ontario standards for
accessibility is an important start to reaching a wider
customer base.

Barriers to the accessibility and usefulness of your
website are encountered not only by customers
with disabilities, but also by people in any situation
where their sight, hearing, mobility or understanding
is limited by circumstance . . . such as a temporary injury, noisy environment
or changing eyesight. There is also an enormous group of people in the aging
demographic, many of whom are expecting (and demanding) more flexible and
more accessible ways of using the web.

There are further benefits of providing accessible websites. An accessibly marked
up website will expose information such as titles, headings, alternate text
descriptions of images, transcripts of audio content and descriptions of video
content. This exposure of more “relevant” content to search engines increases
the possibility of higher rankings in customer-searches (also known as Search
Engine Optimization or SEO). Accessible websites are also easier to convert,
manually or automatically, to be usable with any web-ready device including
tablets, smart-phones, telephone and voice-based systems, and so on.

## In house vs Outsourcing

It takes very little web programming
knowledge to develop a simple website.
Increasingly, even quite complex websites can
be assembled with readily available tools and
building-blocks. However, building websites
that feature the newest technologies and
advanced capabilities still requires expert
knowledge.

Developing a website in-house may be an
option for some organizations, but for many
organizations outsourcing will likely be the
most appropriate route to go.

Regardless of the size or complexity of a
web project, developing websites that meet the AODA’s website accessibility
standards requires very specific expertise which many developers are still
learning – this is true whether the developers are on staff or third parties with
whom you contract. The goods news is that learning how to create accessible
web content isn’t very difficult.

## Choosing a web developer to work with 

Identifying a suitable developer for an accessible website project requires careful
research and screening. It is important to verify that potential developers truly
understand your organization’s needs, as well as the technical requirements for
accessible websites. As a minimum, the website developers you are considering
should demonstrate that they;
• understand accessible requirements under the Accessibility Standard for
Information and Communication
• are technically proficient with the development of accessible website design
and web content; and are
• are able to discuss and communicate technical concepts in layperson terms
Do your research:
Here are some strategies you might consider
to identify a web developer with expertise in
accessible websites and web content:
• Ask potential developers to provide links to
three accessible websites that they have
designed and comply with WCAG 2.0 A or AA
• Interview developers face-to-face, to see how
well you can communicate with each other
• Ask for client references - a minimum of
three is recommended

Reference Checks:
Client references are an excellent source of information on the
technical capabilities of potential developers, as well as their
ability to communicate. Here are some questions you could
consider asking:
• Did the developer understand your company’s accessibility
requirements for its website?
• Did the proponent clearly communicate what they needed
from you to complete the assignment?
• Did the proponent provide you with a schedule, and did
they keep to it?
• Was the assignment completed on time and on budget?
• Are you aware of clients with disabilities using your
website?
• Are your clients with disabilities pleased with the usability of your site?
Assess their work:
Checking the accessibility of websites designed by potential developers is
another great way to assess their understanding of website accessibility
requirements. There are at least three ways to undertake such testing:

• Use On-line testing tools such as AChecker (www.achecker.ca)
• Identify some clients with disabilities and ask them to use the sites
• Hire an accessibility expert to review the sites

## Selection process

There are several ways to assess potential web
developers. One is the formal process of a Request
for Proposals or RFP as a way of identifying suitably
qualified developers. There is a sample of a RFP for
purchasing accessible website design and web content
development services in Appendix A.
You may choose to use a less formal process. In this
case you might want to ask for a written proposal of
the services to be provided, a list of deliverables, a
project schedule, a fee schedule and a schedule for fee
payment.
Here’s a suggested list of tasks that you could ask developers to include in their
proposal.
• Provide a written summary interpreting their understanding of your
business practices and typical clients
• Prepare a project plan, with key deliverables, scheduling milestones and
communication protocols
• Review and test your existing website for accessibility using an automatic
evaluator, manual assessment and assistive technology at the start and
end of project
• Assess and list required changes to achieve WCAG 2.0 Level A or AA
depending on your preference and legal requirements
• Develop and present proposed accessibility update strategy for review,
discussion, and approval
• Pilot technical changes for site navigation and a sample Web page with a
variety of content types
• Testing of the pilot by others
• Full production and implementation

## What you need to provide the developer to achieve a successful project

A successful accessible website development or refresh project will involve
significant input and effort from your organization. The content for the website
should be developed by the individuals, departments or the business units that
are the most familiar with your organizations’ business practices and goals for
the website. Using your in-house information (IT) technology department to
develop or modify content to make it accessible is generally not recommended...
they are technical folks... not content specialists.
What you will need to provide your developer:
• A clear profile of your organization and how it does
business – identify the key products and/or services
that you provide
• A clear description of the purpose of your website
within your business practices
• A clear profile of your clients, and how they access
your products and/or services
• Website content in plain language, that is easy for
your customers to understand
• A logical organizational structure for the information
- be consistent and meaningful with headings and
numbering systems - the fewer mouse clicks the
quicker and easier it will be for your customers to
find the information that they need
• Alternate text descriptions for all diagrams and
images - if it’s too difficult to explain in words, you
might question the complexity of the information
and present it in a different way

## User testing

Before going ‘live’ with a new accessible website, it’s very important to test
it. On-line website accessibility test sites are a good way to evaluate the
accessibility of your site but a manual assessment and testing the site using
assistive technology are essential. However, involving people with disabilities
to test the website is perhaps one of the best ways to ensure your website is
accessible.
People with disabilities are ‘experts’ in using accessible websites so be sure
to include them in your user-testing activities. Possible sources of such users
include:
• staff with disabilities
• focus groups of customers with disabilities
• local organizations that represent people with
disabilities

## Conclusion

Developing an accessible website is a collaborative effort between an
organization and a suitable developer. It doesn’t need to be a difficult or
complicated process, but it does require planning, careful selection of a
developer to work with and comprehensive end-user testing.

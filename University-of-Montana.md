## 6. Procurement﻿
### 6.1 Scope

This process applies to all University purchases of Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) software, hardware and services.

### 6.2 Standards

Purchase orders and contracts for EIT must include the following clause:

    “Contractor acknowledges that no University funds may be expended for the purchase
    of information technology equipment and software for use by employees, program participants, 
    or members of the public unless it provides blind or visually impaired individuals with 
    access, including interactive use of the equipment and services, that is equivalent to 
    that provided to individuals who are not blind or visually impaired. (18-5-603, MCA.) 
    In addition, Contractor acknowledges that such information technology equipment and 
    software will provide equal and effective access to all individuals in accordance with 
    federal and state laws and regulations, including, but not limited to the Americans with 
    Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and 
    Section 508 of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act.”

### 6.3 Responsibility

All Departments and programs/University employees:

Must purchase or otherwise acquire accessible EIT, in accordance with these procedures.

EITA Coordinator and Working Group:

- Will serve as a resource for EIT purchases and other acquisitions for compliance with accessibility requirements.
- Will provide written justification for all provisional use waivers and post such waivers on the accessibility website.  Will provide requests for exceptions to the University ADA/504 Team for public vetting and will include the written comments from the ADA/504 Team in a written recommendation to the President for consideration on requests for exceptions.

### 6.4 Implementation Schedule Summary[i]

- May 1, 2014, the University will develop and institute procedures that require the University to purchase or recommend only EITs that will provide the same programs, benefits, and services as they do to individuals without disabilities, except when it would fundamentally alter a program or when it is not technically feasible to do so, in which case the procedures will require the University to provide accessible alternate EITs.
- By May 1, 2014, the University will implement as part of its request for proposal process a requirement that bidders meet the accessibility standards of WCAG 2.0 Level AA for web-based technology (as set forth in Appendix A to this Agreement) and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act for other EITs; and requiring or encouraging, at the University’s discretion, as part of any contract with its vendors, provisions in which the vendor warrants that any technology provided complies with these standards and any applicable current federal and state disability laws.

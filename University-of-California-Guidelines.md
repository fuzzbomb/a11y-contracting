# University of California: [Guidelines for Purchasing Accessible IT Products or Services](http://www.ucop.edu/electronic-accessibility/_files/uc-guidelines-accessibility-procurement.pdf)

## B. Accessible Procurement Checklist

The following sections provide detail about addressing accessibility in each step of the procurement process. A quick checklist is provided here for easy reference.

- Contact the local EALT member for assistance with finding an IT accessibility expert to participate on the procurement team.
- Include text in the RFP or other procurement process that requires the supplier to submit information about the accessibility of the IT product or service.
- Require the supplier to demonstrate the accessibility of the product, perhaps by having a member of a disabled community use the product in the demonstration.
- Use the standard UC Terms and Conditions for Goods and Services, which require accessibility.
- Have an IT accessibility expert review IT accessibility requirements and expectations with the selected supplier before installation or project initiation.
- Establish procedures to test software updates for accessibility, submit complaints about the product or service via procurement, and ensure issues are remedied.
- Provide feedback to the EALT about addressing accessibility through the procurement process.

## Sample Text for RFPs or Other Procurement Processes

Text should be included in RFP or other procurement processes to request detailed information from suppliers about the accessibility of their IT products or services. The language should be developed with the procurement team. The following paragraphs are provided as examples.

### a. For Web-Based Products/Services (WCAG 2.0 level AA) 

    Bids to the University of California for web-based products or related services must include the
    “UC Web Accessibility Requirements Questionnaire” (available to Procurement staff in the
    library). The questionnaire may be completed by the supplier as a self-assessment or by a UC
    approved web accessibility evaluator. (Include 3rd party evaluation reports as attachments.) Bids
    for services to develop web-related products should include a description of how each
    requirement will be implemented. When requested, suppliers must also provide evaluation
    products for additional UC validation testing.

    For each area of noncompliance, suppliers are strongly encouraged to describe any planned
    remediation roadmaps, including timelines and steps that will be taken to achieve full
    compliance, as well as interim workarounds to enable access by individuals with disabilities.
    In addition, provide the following information:
    • Provide your company’s policy or commitment statement regarding electronic accessibility.
    • Who in your company is responsible for the electronic accessibility policy and compliance (provide contact information)?
    • Do you have an accessibility function or team responsible for technical development? Describe its role in your organization. How does your company achieve compliance with IT accessibility standards?
    • Describe the testing protocols you use to assess the accessibility of your product/service.
    • Can you provide live or pre-recorded demonstrations of the accessibility of your product?
    • How do you assure that you keep your product current with changing legal requirements and accessibility best practices?
    
 
### G. Post Purchase
Once the product or service has been purchased, it is important for IT accessibility experts to meet with the supplier, before installation or project initiation, to review accessibility requirements and
expectations.

It also is important to clarify how product/service accessibility will be maintained throughout the life of the contract. This includes establishing procedures to
• Re-test new versions/updates.
• Evaluate and duplicate any complaints.
• Communicate complaints to the supplier via the procurement team.
• Verify that issues have been remedied.
• Alert the EALT if there are significant accessibility problems with products widely used at UC.
• Provide feedback to the EALT about suppliers, products, and the purchase process to help improve these guidelines.

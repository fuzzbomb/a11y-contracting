    1.  The Column "Clauses met: Fully/Partially/Not" should only be used/included for Award Criteria.
    2.  Where the Functional Accessibility Requirements are used for the Technical Specification, it is presumed that all requirements are met, and therefore this column is not necessary.

Scope
-----

This example consists of the procurement of a web-based internet and intranet system, which includes web content, two-way voice and video communication (e.g. between employees), video capabilities, and the necessary content management system used to maintain and publish new content.

The rendering (display) and interaction with the web content is not part of this procurement, as this functionality is addressed by user agents, such as web browsers and media players, and assistive technologies used by some people with disabilities.

The following aspects are covered in the list of accessibility requirements:

*   generic requirements, such as activation of accessibility features, biometrics, preservation of accessibility information, operable parts, locking or toggle controls, key repeat, double-strike key acceptance and simultaneous user actions;
*   two-way voice or video communication;
*   video capabilities: playback, transmission, conversion of recording of video with synchronized audio;
*   web content success criteria that are equivalent to conformance with WCAG 2.0 level AA;
*   other software-related requirements, such as interoperability with assistive technology, documented accessibility usage, user preferences;
*   authoring tools;
*   documentation and support services.

 The following aspects are not covered in the list of accessibility requirements:

*   closed functionality;
*   hardware;
*   non-web documents and non-web software;
*   web browsers and assistive technologies;
*   relay service provision.

All non-text content that is presented to the user has a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose, except for the situations listed below:

*   **Controls, Input:** If non-text content is a control or accepts user input, then it has a name that describes its purpose. (Refer to WCAG 2.0 Guideline 4.1 for additional requirements for controls and content that accepts user input.)
*   **Time-Based Media:** If non-text content is time-based media, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content. (Refer to WCAG 2.0 Guideline 1.2 for additional requirements for media.)
*   **Test:** If non-text content is a test or exercise that would be invalid if presented in text, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content.
*   **Sensory:** If non-text content is primarily intended to create a specific sensory experience, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content.
*   **CAPTCHA:** If the purpose of non-text content is to confirm that content is being accessed by a person rather than a computer, then text alternatives that identify and describe the purpose of the non-text content are provided, and alternative forms of CAPTCHA using output modes for different types of sensory perception are provided to accommodate different disabilities.
*   **Decoration, Formatting, Invisible:** If non-text content is pure decoration, is used only for visual formatting, or is not presented to users, then it is implemented in a way that it can be ignored by assistive technology.

**WCAG 2.0 success criterion: Meaningful sequence**

When the sequence in which content is presented affects its meaning, a correct reading sequence can be programmatically determined.

9.2.9 Sensory characteristics

Where ICT is a web page, it shall satisfy WCAG 2.0 Success Criterion 1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics.

**WCAG 2.0 success criterion: Sensory characteristics**

Instructions provided for understanding and operating content do not rely solely on sensory characteristics of components such as shape, size, visual location, orientation, or sound.

**NOTE:** For requirements related to colour, refer to WCAG 2.0 Guideline 1.4.

9.2.10 Use of colour

Where ICT is a web page, it shall satisfy WCAG 2.0 Success Criterion 1.4.1 Use of Color.

**WCAG 2.0 success criterion: Use of colour**

Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.

9.2.11 Audio control

Where ICT is a web page, it shall satisfy WCAG 2.0 Success Criterion 1.4.2 Audio Control.

**WCAG 2.0 success criterion: Audio control**

If any audio on a Web page plays automatically for more than 3 seconds, either a mechanism is available to pause or stop the audio, or a mechanism is available to control audio volume independently from the overall system volume level.

**NOTE:** Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the whole page, all content on the Web page (whether or not it is used to meet other success criteria) shall meet this success criterion. See _[Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#cc5)_.

*   **Customizable:** The image of text can be visually customized to the user's requirements.
*   **Essential:** A particular presentation of text is essential to the information being conveyed.

NOTE: Logotypes (text that is part of a logo or brand name) are considered essential.

9.2.15 Keyboard

Where ICT is a web page, it shall satisfy WCAG 2.0 Success Criterion 2.1.1 Keyboard.

**WCAG 2.0 success criterion: Keyboard**

All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes, except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints.

NOTE 1: This exception relates to the underlying function, not the input technique. For example, if using handwriting to enter text, the input technique (handwriting) requires path-dependent input but the underlying function (text input) does not.

NOTE 2: This does not forbid and should not discourage providing mouse input or other input methods in addition to keyboard operation.

9.2.16 No keyboard trap

Where ICT is a web page, it shall satisfy WCAG 2.0 Success Criterion 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap.

**WCAG 2.0 success criterion: No Keyboard Trap**

If keyboard focus can be moved to a component of the page using a keyboard interface, then focus can be moved away from that component using only a keyboard interface, and, if it requires more than unmodified arrow or tab keys or other standard exit methods, the user is advised of the method for moving focus away.

NOTE: Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the whole document, all content on the Web page (whether or not it is used to meet other success criteria) must meet this success criterion.

9.2.17 Timing adjustable

Where ICT is a web page, it shall satisfy WCAG 2.0 Success Criterion 2.2.1 Timing Adjustable.

**WCAG 2.0 success criterion: Timing Adjustable**

For each time limit that is set by the content, at least one of the following is true:

*   **Turn off:** The user is allowed to turn off the time limit before encountering it; or
*   **Adjust:** The user is allowed to adjust the time limit before encountering it over a wide range that is at least ten times the length of the default setting; or
*   **Extend:** The user is warned before time expires and given at least 20 seconds to extend the time limit with a simple action (for example, "press the space bar"), and the user is allowed to extend the time limit at least ten times; or
*   **Real-time Exception:** The time limit is a required part of a real-time event (for example, an auction), and no alternative to the time limit is possible; or
*   **Essential Exception:** The time limit is essential and extending it would invalidate the activity; or
*   **20 Hour Exception:** The time limit is longer than 20 hours.

NOTE: This success criterion helps ensure that users can complete tasks without unexpected changes in content or context that are a result of a time limit. This success criterion should be considered in conjunction with WCAG 2.0 Success Criterion 3.2.1, which puts limits on changes of content or context as a result of user action.

9.2.18 Pause, stop, hide

Where ICT is a web page, it shall satisfy WCAG 2.0 Success Criterion 2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide.

**WCAG 2.0 success criterion: Pause, Stop, Hide**

For moving, blinking, scrolling, or auto-updating information, all of the following are true:

*   **Moving, blinking, scrolling:** For any moving, blinking or scrolling information that (1) starts automatically, (2) lasts more than five seconds, and (3) is presented in parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for the user to pause, stop, or hide it unless the movement, blinking, or scrolling is part of an activity where it is essential; and
*   **Auto-updating:** For any auto-updating information that (1) starts automatically and (2) is presented in parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for the user to pause, stop, or hide it or to control the frequency of the update unless the auto-updating is part of an activity where it is essential.

NOTE 1: For requirements related to flickering or flashing content, refer to WCAG 2.0 Guideline 2.3.

NOTE 2: This success criteria is applicable to all content (whether or not there is an alternate accessible version of the content) since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the whole page (including a link to the alternate version).

NOTE 3: Content that is updated periodically by software or that is streamed to the user agent is not required to preserve or present information that is generated or received between the initiation of the pause and resuming presentation, as this may not be technically possible, and in many situations could be misleading to do so.

NOTE 4: An animation that occurs as part of a preload phase or similar situation can be considered essential if interaction cannot occur during that phase for all users and if not indicating progress could confuse users or cause them to think that content was frozen or broken.

9.2.19 Three flashes or below threshold

Where ICT is a web page, it shall satisfy WCAG 2.0 Success Criterion 2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold.

**WCAG 2.0 success criterion: Three Flashes or Below Threshold**

9.2.37 Parsing

Where ICT is a web page, it shall satisfy WCAG 2.0 Success Criterion 4.1.1 Parsing.

**WCAG 2.0 Success Criterion: Parsing**

In content implemented using markup languages, elements have complete start and end tags, elements are nested according to their specifications, elements do not contain duplicate attributes, and any IDs are unique, except where the specifications allow these features

NOTE: Start and end tags that are missing a critical character in their formation, such as a closing angle bracket or a mismatched attribute value quotation mark are not complete.

9.2.38 Name, role, value

Where ICT is a web page, it shall satisfy WCAG 2.0 Success Criterion 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value.

**WCAG 2.0 Success Criterion: Name, Role, Value**

For all user interface components (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be programmatically determined states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set and notification of changes to these items is available to user agents, including assistive technologies

NOTE: This success criterion is primarily for Web authors who develop or script their own user interface components. For example, standard HTML controls already meet this success criterion when used according to specification.

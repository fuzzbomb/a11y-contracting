# Accessibility and usability

1. It is very important that the site is fully accessible and compliant with the latest WCAG guidelines to at least level AA. The current site was awarded accreditation for web accessibility by the Digital Accessibility Centre, and we would intend to seek similar accreditation for the new site as well.  In addition, our site uses Browsealoud, which reads web pages aloud for people with difficulty reading online, and this should be included in the new site.
2. We will require the site to have been tested by a range of users including those with protected characteristics and using assistive technologies for the blind and visually impaired.  At the end of the site build, we will request an Accessibility Report, which should include a report of user testing results, what validation tools have been used and the quality assurance process used.
3. It is also important that the site complies fully with web standards required of a government body and with current cookies policies.

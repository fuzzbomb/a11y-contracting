## An amended version of the [Commonwealth Procurement Rules (CPRs)](https://www.finance.gov.au/procurement/procurement-policy-and-guidance/commonwealth-procurement-rules/) commenced on 1 March 2017.

    10.9c base technical specifications on international standards, when they exist and apply to the relevant procurement, except when the use of international standards would fail to meet the relevant entityâ€™s requirements or would impose greater burdens than the use of recognised Australian standards.

    10.10 Where an Australian standard is applicable for goods or services being procured, tender responses must demonstrate the capability to meet the Australian standard, and contracts must contain evidence of the applicable standards (see
paragraph 10.37).

    10.37 Where applying a standard (Australian, or in its absence, international) for goods or services, relevant entities must make reasonable enquiries to determine compliance with that standard:

        a. this includes gathering evidence of relevant certifications; and
        
        b. periodic auditing of compliance by an independent assessor.

This Standard is identical with, and has been reproduced from EN 301 549 V1.1.2 (2015-04),

The Commonwealth Procurement Rules (Section10.9) direct procurers to base technical specifications on recognized International Standards when they exist and are applicable to the goods or services being procured.

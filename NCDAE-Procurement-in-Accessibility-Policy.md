# [Samples of procurement language](http://www.ncdae.org/resources/articles/procurement.php)
Although it is important that any contract language is reviewed by legal counsel, the following represent three samples of procurement language that can be added to enhance accessibility of purchased or licensed products. In these samples, the Section 508 standard is used. Of course any group would want to align their own accessibility standard to what is required of the vendors. These samples represent (1) requests for proposals, (2) purchasing contracts of specific products, and (3) purchasing procedures used for general purchasing:

Three samples of procurement language to enhance accessibility efforts:

## Sample 1: Contained in a Request for Proposal

    NOTICE -- All electronic and information technology (EIT) procured through this RFP
    must meet the applicable accessibility standards of 36 CFR 1194. 36 CFR 1194 implements 
    Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and is viewable at the 
    following URL: http://www.section508.gov The following Section 508 technical standards 
    are applicable to this RFP, as a minimum: " Software Applications and Operating Systems (1194.21)"
    Web-based Intranet and Internet Information and Applications (1194.22) " Video or 
    Multimedia Products (1194.24) C.4 Applicants must state their level of compliance to 
    applicable sections to be considered for purchase under this RFP.

## Sample 2: Purchasing contracts of specific products

    Vendors must ensure that the course management system contained in the proposal fully 
    conforms with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended in 1998.  (For 
    information on Section 508 see www.section508.gov). This includes both the student and 
    instructor views and also includes all interaction tools (e.g., chats, discussion forums), 
    and add-ons (e.g., grade functions). Vendors must declare if any portion of the version 
    under consideration does not fully conform to Section 508, and the ways in which the 
    proposed product is out of compliance.

## Sample 3: Purchasing procedures used for general purchasing

    To ensure the procurement of Section 508 compliant products and services, the procurement 
    officer shall ask the vendor whether the product or solution is Section 508 compliant, 
    and if so, the vendor must provide Section 508 compliance audit or test results that 
    document the testing methodology utilized to determine the product or solution's 
    compliance and the results of the accessibility audit.  It is also important for the 
    procurement officer to note whether the testing was conducted by the vendor or whether 
    an independent third party auditor was retained.
    
Remember that in this age of information technology and accessibility let the buyer be AWARE, of both their action and inaction. Adding a simple element, such as procurement policies, can have an enormous and lasting impact.
